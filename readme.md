# [slack-export-viewer](https://quillford.github.io/slack-export-viewer/)

convert slack json exports to readable txt files (converts timestamps to pst/pdt)

this tool converts archives made with [this script](https://github.com/alexwlchan/backup-slack), which is better than the official slack export because it includes direct messages
